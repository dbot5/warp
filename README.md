# Warp9

Warp9 provides a development framework for developing servcies that share and consume network based resources.

The fundamental paradigm of Warp9 is:

- represent resources as a collection of objects
- create a simple consistent access method to interact with those objects
- orgainze the objects in a hiearchical namespace
- allow namespaces to be highly configurable and dynamic
- connect all resoruces via a simple remote access protocol over a reliable network

The framework will provide a set of types, functions, daemons to allow the development of resource provieders and resource consumers.
